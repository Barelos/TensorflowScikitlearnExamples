Abstract:
    Two examples of training 3 types classifiers.
    The classifiers are of type:
        1) K nearest neighbors
        2) Tree classifier
        3) Neural Net

    For the first two the scikit-learn module is used.
    The neural net is implemented with tensor flow.

    For a more hands on implementation of a neural net including
    implementation of backpropagation see other project on my GitHub
    called HelloNN.

    The datasets for this projects are taken from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
    This is in general a great site to get datasets.
